In order to use it you need to own a Solid POD, you can get one [here](https://solidproject.org/for-developers#hosted-pod-services).\n\n[learn more](https://solidproject.org)\n\n## Browser storage (IndexedDB)\n\nIf you only want to try the app or you don't want to synchronize with other devices, you should use browser storage.\n\nThis will store your data in a local database and it won't be accessible from other devices. You can always export/import your data in json format, so feel free to get started with browser storage and upgrade to using Solid when you need it.\n\n[learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_Database_API)\n"}}]);
