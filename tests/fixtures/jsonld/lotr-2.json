Their destinies lie at two towers--Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where the corrupt wizard Saruman awaits, and Sauron's fortress at Barad-dur, deep within the dark lands of Mordor. Frodo and Sam are trekking to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power while Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn search for the orc-captured Merry and Pippin. All along, nefarious wizard Saruman awaits the Fellowship members at the Orthanc Tower in Isengard.","datePublished":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2002-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5VTN0pR8gcqV3EPUHHfMGnJYN9L.jpg","sameAs":["https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/121","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261"],"actions":[{"@type":"WatchAction","startTime":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2024-12-27T10:02:47.246Z"},"endTime":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2024-12-27T10:02:47.246Z"},"purl:created":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2024-12-27T10:02:47.247Z"},"@id":"browser-storage://movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-2002#172bc235-3ac1-4ed0-8eb4-f74d6f861d19"}]}
