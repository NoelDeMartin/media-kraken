# Application Storage

## Solid

If you want to secure your data and access it from other devices, you should use Solid.

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards that aims to bring data ownership to the web. In order to use it you need to own a Solid POD, you can get one [here](https://solid.inrupt.com/get-a-solid-pod).

## Browser storage (IndexedDB)

If you only want to try the app or you don't want to synchronize with other devices, you should use browser storage.

This will store your data in a local database and it won't be accessible from other devices. You can always export/import your data in json format, so feel free to get started with browser storage and upgrade to using Solid when you need it.
