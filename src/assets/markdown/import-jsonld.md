# Import from JSON-LD

If you are not able to import your data with the other options, you can upload a JSON file containing linked data. This can be useful to export/import your data when you are <button data-trigger="show-markdown:application-storage" type="button" class="link">using browser storage</button>.

You can also transform the data from other sources yourself, consult the expected format [here](%url%).

Learn more about linked data and the JSON-LD format at [json-ld.org](https://json-ld.org), and inspect your data [at the Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground).
